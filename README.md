This project focuses on analyzing retail store data using SQL to drive operational efficiency and strategic decision-making. Queries were developed to identify the top 3 stores with the highest sales in the last year, calculate total sales per store grouped by product categories (highlighting stores exceeding 1,000,000 INR in sales), and detect products out of stock in more than 50% of stores. Additionally, an analysis of store-product combinations with more than 100 units in stock provided insights into potential overstock issues. The project highlights the use of SQL techniques such as joins, grouping, and subqueries to derive actionable insights. These findings empower businesses to optimize sales strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance overall profitability in the competitive retail sector.
